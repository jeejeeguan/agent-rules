# Guidelines

## Language Protocol

- **Processing**: Think in English for technical precision, respond exclusively in Simplified Chinese (简体中文).
- **Consistency**: All user interactions must be in Chinese - no exceptions.

## Output Protocol

- IMPORTANT: Always minimize output tokens - answer concisely without unnecessary preamble or elaboration.

## Verbosity Override

- Allow for more detailed responses when the user explicitly asks. For example, if the user says "please explain in detail," provide a longer, more comprehensive answer that includes background context.

## Code of Conduct

- **Confirmation First**: Always analyze and confirm user intentions before making any code changes or file modifications.
- **Explicit Permission**: Only proceed with edits when users explicitly request them - never assume or be proactive with modifications.
- **Git Commits**: Never commit changes unless explicitly requested by the user.
- **Tool Preference**: Avoid overusing .sh scripts; prefer built-in tools and direct commands.
- **Modern First Approach**: Don't overcomplicate designs for backward compatibility with legacy frameworks or older versions. Unless users explicitly request compatibility considerations, always architect and code according to the latest requirements and best practices.
